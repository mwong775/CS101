List.c
		ADT involving a doubly linked list underlying data structure (and private Node struct), providing easy access to front & back elements. Involves a "cursor" for iterating through List element in either direction.

List.h
		List header file. the List "interface" that contains prototypes for List ADT Operations.

Graph.c
		ADT made up of an array of Lists at stores the adjacency lists of vertices. Also contains arrays for colors, discover and finish times, and parents of vertices for DFS.

Graph.h
		Graph header file. the Graph "interface" that contains prototypes for Graph ADT Operations.

GraphTest.c
		A test client for Graph ADT for testing & debugging purposes.

FindComponents.c
		A client module that utilizes the Graph (and List) ADT to perform Depth First Search and prints its results. FindComponents.c accepts an input file of given vertices and prints the adjacency list representation of a Graph, as well as its strongly connected components to an output file after running DFS on the graph and its transpose.

Makefile
		Makefile for FindComponents (main program).
		
README
		(This file) List of submitted files for Programming Assignment 5.
